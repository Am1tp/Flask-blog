## What is this project?

A small blog website project that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## How to run:

First make sure a '.env' file is in the root directory of the project, this will contain the following variables required by the project:
'FLASK_KEY': The secret key for the Flask app
'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI' The config for SQLAlchemy to tell it which database to connect to

Run the file main.py

## Future improvements/ideas

Add a working contact form (I have created this seperately in an earlier project, just need to test and add the functionality to this one)
Add a section that links to other interesting websites/blogs
Add more personalisation
